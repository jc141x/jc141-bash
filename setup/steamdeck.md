### Setup Guide - SteamDeck - Arch

#### Install any Arch distro. We recommend EndeavourOS.

1. Create a bootable usb drive with the distro iso. - [Guide](https://discovery.endeavouros.com/installation/create-install-media-usb-key/2021/03/)
2. Use a USB-C adapter to connect the drive to your deck.
3. Turn off your deck, hold 'Volume Down' and click the Power button, when you hear a sound let go of the volume button.
4. Select the usb efi device.
5. Follow installer steps. Pick KDE Plasma if you want to deal with least amount of issues. (online install)
6. Boot into new system and run `sudo pacman -Syyu` then reboot again.

### Done

Please head back to the main setup page now and follow the instructions for Arch based distros there.

### Post-setup

On KDE Plasma, you might need to go into settings and set the correct screen position. On other DE's you might be stuck with no such options.
