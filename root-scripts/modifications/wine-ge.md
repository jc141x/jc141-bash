Remove
```sh
# wine
export WINE="$(command -v wine)"
```

And add
```sh
# wine-ge
export WINE="$JCD/wine/wine-ge/wine/bin/wine" && { ping -c 3 github.com >/dev/null || { echo "Github could not be reached, probably no network or ping command was blocked. The game may or may not fail to run if wine-ge was never downloaded before." ; }
