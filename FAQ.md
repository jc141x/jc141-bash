### Frequently Asked Questions

This is a page in construction which will contain answers to frequently asked questions.

Q: Do the releases include all DLCs?
A: Yes. If there is a release where that is not the case, report it to us.

Q: Why use the dwarfs format? It makes it less convenient for users.
A: Our purpose is to serve a community which is involved enough to be able to follow a short setup page. It enables us to provide users with new technological features that we find useful. We believe that users which don't have the patience for such details might as well not have the patience to use proper file sources and which just happened to find our release online on a fake website. Such a user is not important to us.


Q: Do you accept requests?
A: Yes, though it will depend on our uploaders interest and priority. The game needs to meet our minimuim quality standards for us to upload it. This means that the game must be rated above 85% on steam; alternatively metacritic if the game does not have a steam release. The game also needs to run stabily and smoothely.


Q: Why are games that have native ports uploaded using the WIndows release with WINE?
A: If the native port performs better than with WINE it will be uploaded if we can source the game files. If you see a WINE version of a game with a native port we either could not source the native files, the native performance does not differ, or the native port is buggy or broken. 


Q: Why do you not post Empress Denuvo Cracks?
A: Empress is a polarising member of the Piracy scene and has expressed signs of mental instability. Above this, due to their releases being heavily obfascated, the authenticity cannot be verified. For our, and our users security we recommend against the use of her releases.
