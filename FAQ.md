### Frequently Asked Questions

This is a page in construction which will contain answers to frequently asked questions.

Q: Do the releases include all DLCs?

Y: Yes. If there is a release where that is not the case, report it to us.

Q: Why use the dwarfs format? It makes it less convenient for users.

A: Our purpose is to serve a community which is involved enough to be able to follow a short setup page. It enables us to provide users with new technological features that we find useful. We believe that users which don't have the patience for such details might as well not have the patience to use proper file sources and which just happened to find our release online on a fake website. Such a user is not important to us.
