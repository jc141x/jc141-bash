### Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do the releases include all DLCs?

A: Yes. If there is a release where that is not the case, report it to us.

Q: Which torrents are seeded?

A: All of them. If what you are reffering to is the official list of torrents we have published at the moment you see them. We do not keep seeding torrents we removed from the public list. The seeding is done by seedboxes paid by us as well as individuals. When asking for a torrent to be seeded, the request is pointless. You would rather look into why your client cannot connect to peers. The torrent protocol is not perfect and you are likely to find torrents which you just can't download even though it has seeders as mentioned. We can't exactly fix this situation without a lot more investment.

Q: Why use the dwarfs format? It makes it less convenient for users.

A: Our purpose is to serve a community which is involved enough to be able to follow a short setup page. It enables us to provide users with new technological features that we find useful. We believe that users which don't have the patience for such details might as well not have the patience to use proper file sources and which just happened to find our release online on a fake website. Such a user is not important to us.

Q: Why do you have such a bad opinion of Ubuntu?

A: Ubuntu is an OS more akin to Windows than GNU/Linux distros in the last few years. Their decisions gradually are more and more worrying. Just using the Linux kernel does not mean that the system is part of the community of distributions. Microsoft also uses Linux with their WSL project. What the community gathered around for is the ideology behind these distros, their commitment to enable freedom to their users. Ubuntu does not appeal to that idea.

Q: Why do you not support SteamOS, when you support SteamDeck through Arch?

A: Besides the ideological issues of SteamOS being made by a mega corporation with their embedded proprietary software, it is not possible to setup a proper system which can operate normally. Very quirky workarounds are needed and which do not even work from our testing. The ideological issue is very important to us and so we won't change our stance. But we're looking to provide more supported Distros for SteamDeck.

Q: Do you accept requests?


A: Yes, we do accept requests, but it depends on our uploader's interest and priority. For us to upload a game, it needs to meet our minimum quality standards. This means that the game must be rated above 85% on Steam or Metacritic if the game does not have a Steam release. Additionally, the game needs to run stably and smoothly. (exceptions can be made)

---

Q: Why have such high expectations from games? Shouldn't you just upload new releases as they come?

A: We have a different objective. It is building and improving a catalogue of games which we believe users will find very enjoyable to play and which do not have technical issues such as performance or bugs (ideally). Our idea is to maintain the releases and fix them if anything is wrong about them as well as systematically updating the oldest ones. Keeping up with newest game releases regardless of any standards would conflict with these ideals and frequently falls into the state of providing shovelware.

Q: Why are games that have native ports uploaded using the Windows release with WINE?


A: If the native port performs better than with WINE, we will upload it if we can source the game files. If you see a WINE version of a game with a native port, we either could not source the native files, the native performance does not differ, or the native port is buggy or broken.

---

Q: Why do you not post Empress Denuvo Cracks?


A: We do not post Empress Denuvo cracks because Empress is a polarizing member of the piracy scene and has expressed signs of mental instability. Additionally, due to their releases being heavily obfuscated, the authenticity cannot be verified. For our and our users' security, we recommend against the use of her releases.

---

Q: What is the reason for using Wine-ge and Wine-staging instead of Valve's Proton?

A: Firstly very few games require the patches from Proton and Wine-GE. Proton has some Steam-specific bloat, which may not be necessary and may interfere with crack functionality for Games. Wine-GE, on the other hand, is designed for use outside of Steam, and disables the steamuser and steamclient functionality that is specific to Proton.  Wine-GE offers these patches without the bloat for the select few games that need the patches.

---

Q: Where do you trust source your game files or where would you recommend?

A: We use our own clean steamfiles (the game depot dumped from steam servers with no modifactions) or from cs.rin.ru and we apply the necessary cracks ourselves.  We alternatively use gog-games.to for sourcing gog rips (refering to the offline installer that is untouched sourced from gog) and scene releases or preservations of scene releases from myabandonware.com or an internal collection for any non-digital titles.

---

Q: Do you or would you consider uploading cracked Software?

A: It's not a area we're interested in or experienced with. And we don't really find the need for proprietary programs in our systems. Besides games.
