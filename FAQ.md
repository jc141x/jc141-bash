### Frequently Asked Questions

This is a page in construction which will contain answers to frequently asked questions.

Q: Do the releases include all DLCs?

Y: Yes. If there is a release where that is not the case, report it to us.

Q: Why use the dwarfs format? It makes it less convenient for users.

A: Our purpose is to serve a community which is involved enough to be able to follow a short setup page. It enables us to provide users with new technological features that we find useful. We believe that users which don't have the patience for such details might as well not have the patience to use proper file sources and which just happened to find our release online on a fake website. Such a user is not important to us.


Q: Why do you have such a bad opinion of Ubuntu?


A: Ubuntu is an OS more akin to Windows than GNU/Linux distros in the last few years. Their decisions gradually are more and more worrying. Just using the Linux kernel does not mean that the system is part of the community of distributions. Microsoft also uses Linux with their WSL project. What the community gathered around for is the ideology behind these distros, their commitment to enable freedom to their users. Ubuntu does not appeal to that idea.
